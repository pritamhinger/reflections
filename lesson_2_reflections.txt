What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It create a hidden folder .git containing all the metadata information about the repository directory and its content.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is the space between working directory and repository. Staging area give us a place where we can add all the file which 
we think of as a logical change to be included in single commit. Also, according to me, it  provide a precautionary check before we commit.
