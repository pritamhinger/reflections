Q. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

Ans: When i want others to have a look at my work or i have a team of 2 or more people working on same code, then
i definitely would want to use a remote repository. Also keeping all work locally can be dangerous as well as local
machine may crash and we may loose all our data. Thus timely updating remote repository keeps your work safe and make 
it easier for others to follow and contribute in your work.
